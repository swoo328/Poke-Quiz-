# summary
I created a multiple choice pokemon quiz that is created using html, css 
and javascript. When you click the start button, the application will present 
you with a question and a timer. As you answer the question, it will take you to 
another question. However, if you answer the question wrong, there's a penalty of 5 
seconds off the timer and when the timer hits zero, the quiz is over. If you answer the question correctly, you are rewarded a point to the score. At the end of the quiz, you are presented with a score you obtained and it will be saved on the score page.
